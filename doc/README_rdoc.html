<h2>acts_as_hausdorff_space</h2>
</p>
<p>
acts_as_hausdorff_space is a gemified mixin for Rails ActiveRecord. It
implements the nested set model for maintaining recursive trees in a
database, but using real numbers rather than integers because real numbers
are a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_space">Hausdorff
Space</a> and the integers aren&#8217;t
</p>
<p>
<h2> Installation </h2>
</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure you have <a href="http://gems.github.com">gems.github.com</a> set
up in your gem sources

</li>
<li>sudo gem install acts-as-hausdorff-space

</li>
<li>In environment.rb add <tt> config.gem
&quot;acts-as-hausdorff-space&quot;</tt>

</li>
<li>Create a migration with left and right columns using the biggest decimal
representations available on your database.

</li>
<li>Add

<pre>
 &lt;tt&gt; acts_as_hausdorff_space &lt;/tt&gt;
</pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
to your model.

<h2>A Problem with Nested Sets - Mega Peformance Issues</h2>
</p>
<p>
I was using the better_nested_set plugin in a territories model and trying
to load all the countries in the world and all the regions and sub-regions
and it was taking utterly ages. So I set about thinking what could be done
to improve performance. I&#8217;d written the code for nested sets before a
long time ago using Delphi &amp; Interbase, so I knew the problems. But in
the meantime I&#8217;d learned some topology theory so I had a name and a
concept to put to what must have been starting everyone in the face .
Hausdorff Spaces! Integers aren&#8217;t a Hausdorff space but we&#8217;re
trying to implement a concept, namely nested sets, which are the defining
characteristic of a Hausdorff space, so we have to write extra code to
fudge integers to behave like they are a Hausdorff space and that is the
source of the performance hit. So the obvious thing to do is to use real
numbers which are a Hausdorff space and then the extra code and associated
performance hit melts away. After some fussing about version 0.1.0 is now
released. For small trees the overhead of using BigDecimal rather than
integers makes this method slower, but as the trees get bigger the relative
performance soon switches in favour of using BigDecimals. check the table
at the bottom to see how big the performance improvements can be.
</p>
<p>
<h2>A bit of history</h2>
</p>
<p>
Joe Celko, an SQL guru, popularized the idea of using nested sets for
databases back in his 1996 article reproduced <a
href="http://www.dbmsmag.com/9603d06.html">here</a>. Though the earliest
description is in <a href="http://www.kamfonas.com/id3.html">Kamfonas</a>.
Since it&#8217;s usually a bad idea to go against the advice of an SQL guru
every implementation I&#8217;ve seen follows his example in using integers
to set the nesting boundaries. So every implementation has had to deal with
the awkwardness that comes with using integers in a way they can&#8217;t
inherently be used. The description in <a
href="http://www.kamfonas.com/id3.html">Kamfonas</a> recomends using a
SKIP-VALUE to make sure you&#8217;ve got some space to put new entries in.
Though the code for that is obviously going to be complicated because
you&#8217;d need to work out a skip value for each node if you&#8217;re
adding a collection of nodes inside an already existing node. This is the
kind of coding fudge people have to do to make nested sets maintainable.
</p>
<p>
<h2>The Basic Idea</h2> This is copied from <a
href="http://threebit.net/tutorials/nestedset/tutorial1.html">ThreeBit</a>
and is the example used in better_nested_sets. The example uses integers.
</p>
<p>
An easy way to visualize how a nested set works is to think of a parent
entity surrounding all of its children, and its parent surrounding it, etc.
So this tree:
</p>
<pre>
  root
    |_ Child 1
      |_ Child 1.1
      |_ Child 1.2
    |_ Child 2
      |_ Child 2.1
      |_ Child 2.2
</pre>
<p>
Could be visualized like this:
</p>
<pre>
    ___________________________________________________________________
   |  Root                                                             |
   |    ____________________________    ____________________________   |
   |   |  Child 1                  |   |  Child 2                  |   |
   |   |   __________   _________  |   |   __________   _________  |   |
   |   |  |  C 1.1  |  |  C 1.2 |  |   |  |  C 2.1  |  |  C 2.2 |  |   |
   1   2  3_________4  5________6  7   8  9_________10 11_______12 13  14
   |   |___________________________|   |___________________________|   |
   |___________________________________________________________________|
</pre>
<p>
The numbers represent the left and right boundaries. The table then might
look like this:
</p>
<pre>
   id | parent_id | lft  | rgt  | data
    1 |           |    1 |   14 | root
    2 |         1 |    2 |    7 | Child 1
    3 |         2 |    3 |    4 | Child 1.1
    4 |         2 |    5 |    6 | Child 1.2
    5 |         1 |    8 |   13 | Child 2
    6 |         5 |    9 |   10 | Child 2.1
    7 |         5 |   11 |   12 | Child 2.2
</pre>
<p>
To get all children of an entry <tt>parent</tt>, you
</p>
<pre>
    SELECT * WHERE lft IS BETWEEN parent.lft AND parent.rgt
</pre>
<p>
To get the number of children, it&#8217;s
</p>
<pre>
    (right - left - 1)/2
</pre>
<p>
To get a node and all its ancestors going back to the root, you
</p>
<pre>
    SELECT * WHERE node.lft IS BETWEEN lft AND rgt
</pre>
<h4></h4>
<p>
Notes. Pretty obviously if you wanted to add a new child with C.1.1 as
parent you&#8217;ll have to update the entire tree from 4 onwards because
there is no integer between 3 and 4.
</p>
<p>
<h2>A bit of topological theory</h2>
</p>
<p>
There is no integer between 3 and 4, but there are an uncountable infinity
of real numbers between 3 and 4. That is the crux of the problem. Between
any two real numbers there is always another real number, no matter how
close they are. This property was first described by Archimedes and
it&#8217;s called the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedean_property#Archimedean_property_of_the_real_numbers">Archimedean
property of real numbers</a>
</p>
<p>
What that means is that for real numbers we can surround any two of them
with disjoint open neighbourhoods and that is the defining property of a <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_space">Hausdorff Space</a>.
That property of being able to put any two points inside disjoint sets of
nearby points means you can have infinite levels of nesting. The notion of
nested sets is inherently part of a Hausdorff space, but not of the
integers, which is why you have to write lots of awkward slow code to
maintain nested sets implemented with integers
</p>
<p>
<h2>The Implementation in Abstract</h2>
</p>
<p>
The implementation is the same as above, with two differences. I&#8217;m
not using parent_id because that defeats the main advantage of the nested
set model over the adjaceny list model and I&#8217;m using real numbers.
That means if we want to add a record between 3 and 4, we can make lft =
3.25 and rgt = 3.5, and we can keep on adding records to any depth or width
of tree we like, without having to update the rest of the tree.
</p>
<p>
<h2>The Real Life Implementation Constraints</h2>
</p>
<p>
Computers don&#8217;t use real numbers, they use binary arithmetic to
emulate real numbers. That means the lovely idea has to get ugly when it
meets the real world. There are maximum sizes for the real numbers used and
also minimum sizes depending on the real number precision limits. But
within those constraints we can implement the concept of nested sets using
real numbers fairly easily. We just have to keep our calculations away from
bumping up against the lower and upper limits. It means that there&#8217;s
going to be a limit to the number of children a parent node can own, and
also a limit to the depth of the tree. Most trees used in nested sets in
relational databases aren&#8217;t very deep, but they can be very wide.
When we add a new node into a gap in the tree we have to make sure it
leaves a gap between itself and its siblings or the parent lefts and
rights. That way we will always have some space to put a new record in the
gap, as long as the gap isn&#8217;t so small that we&#8217;re bumping up
against the limits of decimal precision. So when you set up your tables
always choose the maximum precision for that database.
</p>
<p>
The other issue when we add a new record, we want to leave space for more
records but we don&#8217;t know in advance how many records to leave space
for. We could do what&#8217;s done in the integer implementations of nested
sets, move every lft and rgt along a bit, but that is where the performance
hit comes from. So we have to leave gaps and fill them as best we can. If
each new node were to take up half of the remaining space between its
siblings and the boundaries of its parent, then we&#8217;d pretty soon bump
up against the decimal precision limit. To avoid that I&#8217;ve set things
up so that there&#8217;s a number called the bias, which is a division
factor. It works like this, I add a new child to a parent, I use the bias
to work out where to place the child inside what ever gap remains, roughly
(remaining gap)/bias. So the bigger the bias the less of the remaining gap
is taken up. The default bias is one million, to allow for wide and shallow
trees.
</p>
<p>
<h2> Relative Performance </h2>
</p>
<p>
For small trees integers are faster, for large trees
acts_as_hausdorff_space using BigDecimals are faster by a large margin. To
get a rough estimate of performance I wrote a test which adds 1000 children
to a root node, then goes through each child node adding children. This
really hammers the integer implementation of nested sets since every new
insertion requires updating every node to the right of the new insertion.
The full test description and updated results are <a
href="http://mindoro-marine.co.uk/nested_sets_tests">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
No. of children added is the number of child nodes added to each of the
1000 children of the root. aahs = acts_as_hausdorff_space, bns = using the
better_nested_set mixin.
</p>
<pre>
              |      SQLite3       |          MySQL           |
  No of       | aahs    | bns      | aahs       | bns         |

  2           | 51      | 116      | 51         | 7,692       |
  3           | 62      | 203      | 63         | 24,555      |
  4           | 73      | 312      | 75         | I gave up   |
  5           | 84      | 444      | 87         |             |
  6           | 96      | 596      | 99         |             |
  7           | 109     | 765      | 113        |             |
  8           | 121     | 952      | 129        |             |
  9           | 131     | 1156     | 144        |             |
</pre>
<p>
As you can see adding children into large trees using
acts_as_hausdorff_space (aahs) is nice and linear in the number of children
added. Using the integer method implemented by better_nested_set things are
much slower and on MySQL the time taken blows up quite quickly.
</p>
<p>
I&#8217;ll be testing Postgres and trying to work out why MySQL blows up so
badly.
